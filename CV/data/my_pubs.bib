	abstract = {Quantifying the amount of rainfall needed to generate groundwater recharge is important for the sustainable management of groundwater resources. Here, we quantify rainfall recharge thresholds using drip loggers situated in a near-surface cave: Wildman's Cave at Wombeyan, southeast Australia. In just over 2 years of monitoring, 42 potential recharge events were identified in the cave, approximately 4 m below the land surface and comprising a 30° slope with 37 \% bare rock. Recharge events occurred within 48 h of rainfall. Using daily precipitation data, the median 48 h rainfall needed to generate recharge was 19.8 mm, without clear seasonal variability. An intense experimental fire experiment was conducted 18 months into the monitoring period: the median 48 h rainfall needed to generate recharge was 22.1 mm before the fire (n= 22) and 16.4 mm after the fire (n= 20), with the decrease in rainfall recharge most noticeable starting 3 months after the fire. Rainfall recharge thresholds and the number of potential recharge events at Wildman's Cave are consistent with those published from other caves in water-limited Australia. At Wildman's Cave, we infer that soil water storage, combined with the generation of overland flow over bare limestone surfaces, is the pathway for water movement to the subsurface via fractures and that these determine the rainfall recharge threshold. Immediately after the fire, surface ash deposits initially retard overland flow, and after ash removal from the land surface, soil loss and damage decrease the available soil water storage capacity, leading to more efficient infiltration and a decreased rainfall recharge threshold.},

	abstract = {Understanding organic matter (OM) in cave mineral deposits (speleothems) is essential for interpreting land use and climatic changes, and the incorporation of trace elements associated with organic compounds. However, the sources and composition of OM in speleothems are poorly understood due to challenges associated with measuring OM at low concentrations and the destructive nature of most speleothem OM analysis techniques. Synchrotron Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy is a promising non-destructive technique that can be used to investigate stalagmite OM composition. We use FTIR to analyse vegetation, soil, calcium carbonate and ash end-members and demonstrate the use of Synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy (IRM) mapping to detect temporal changes in the OM composition of a stalagmite from a shallow cave in south-west Western Australia. Our analysis reveals predominant FTIR peaks in the stalagmite linked to amides and CH2 groups, suggesting potential microbial contributions, with smaller proportions of aromatic, CH3 and CO groups. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed that this OM is likely hosted in sets of nanopores spaced hundreds of nanometers apart, aligned along calcite crystallographic orientations. Furthermore, we assess the impact of known wildfire events as discrete short term environmental changes on the stalagmite’s OM composition. The temporal variability in OM functional group composition after fires implies complex fire-soil-vegetation-microbial interactions. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of Synchrotron IRM mapping in providing insights into the short and long-term environmental influences on stalagmite OM composition. Expanding this research to other regions and climates could further enhance the interpretation of OM changes in speleothem-based palaeoclimate reconstructions.},

	abstract = {Wildfires affect 40\% of the earth's terrestrial biome, but much of our knowledge of wildfire activity is limited to the satellite era. Improved understanding of past fires is necessary to better forecast how fire regimes might change with future climate change, to understand ecosystem resilience to fire, and to improve data-model comparisons. Environmental proxy archives can extend our knowledge of past fire activity. Speleothems, naturally occurring cave formations, are widely used in paleoenvironmental research as they are absolutely dateable, occur on every ice-free continent, and include multiple proxies. Recently, speleothems have been shown to record past fire events (Argiriadis et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00767; McDonough et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2022.03.020; Homann et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34950-x). Here we present a review of this emerging application in speleothem paleoenvironmental science. We give a concise overview of fire regimes and common paleofire proxies, describe past attempts to use stalagmites to investigate paleofire, and describe the physical basis through which speleothems can record past fires. We then describe the ideal speleothem sample for paleofire research and offer a summary of applicable laboratory and statistical methods. Finally, we present four case studies from southwest Australia which: (a) explore the geochemistry of ash leachates, (b) detail how sulfate isotopes may be a proxy for post fire ecological recovery, (c) demonstrate how a catastrophic paleofire was linked to changes in climate and land management, and (d) investigate whether deep caves can record past fire events. We conclude the paper by outlining future research directions for paleofire applications.},

	abstract = {We propose a Bayesian model which produces probabilistic reconstructions of hydroclimatic variability in Queensland Australia. The model provides a standardized approach to hydroclimate reconstruction using multiple palaeoclimate proxy records derived from natural archives such as speleothems, ice cores and tree rings. The method combines time-series modeling with inverse prediction to quantify the relationships between a given hydroclimate index and relevant proxies over an instrumental period and subsequently reconstruct the hydroclimate back through time. We present case studies for Brisbane and Fitzroy catchments focusing on two hydroclimate indices, the Rainfall Index (RFI) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The probabilistic nature of the reconstructions allows us to estimate the probability that a hydroclimate index in any reconstruction year was lower (higher) than the minimum (maximum) value observed over the instrumental period. In Brisbane, the RFI is unlikely (probabilities {\textless} 5\%) to have exhibited extremes beyond the minimum/maximum values observed between 1889 and 2019. However, in Fitzroy there are several years during the reconstruction period where the RFI is likely ({\textgreater}50\% probability) to have exhibited behavior beyond the minimum/maximum of what has been observed, during the instrumental period. For SPEI, the probability of observing such extremes prior to the beginning of the instrumental period in 1889 doesn't exceed 30\% in any reconstruction year in Brisbane, but exceeds 50\% in multiple years in Fitzroy.},

	abstract = {Palaeoclimate data relating to hydroclimate variability over the past millennia have a vital contribution to make to the water sector globally. The water industry faces considerable challenges accessing climate data sets that extend beyond that of historical gauging stations. Without this, variability around the extremes of floods and droughts is unknown and stress-testing infrastructure design and water demands is challenging. User-friendly access to relevant palaeoclimate data is now essential, and importantly, an efficient process to determine which proxies are most relevant to a planning scenario, and geographic area of interest. This paper presents PalaeoWISE (Palaeoclimate Data for Water Industry and Security Planning) a fully integrated, and quality-assured database of proxy data extracted from data repositories and publications collated in Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format. We demonstrate the application of the database in Queensland, one of Australia’s most hydrologically extreme states. The database and resultant hydroclimate correlations provides both the scientific community, and water resource managers, with a valuable resource to better manage for future climate changes.},
