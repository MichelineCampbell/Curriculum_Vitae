	abstract = {We propose a Bayesian model which produces probabilistic reconstructions of hydroclimatic variability in Queensland Australia. The model provides a standardized approach to hydroclimate reconstruction using multiple palaeoclimate proxy records derived from natural archives such as speleothems, ice cores and tree rings. The method combines time-series modeling with inverse prediction to quantify the relationships between a given hydroclimate index and relevant proxies over an instrumental period and subsequently reconstruct the hydroclimate back through time. We present case studies for Brisbane and Fitzroy catchments focusing on two hydroclimate indices, the Rainfall Index (RFI) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The probabilistic nature of the reconstructions allows us to estimate the probability that a hydroclimate index in any reconstruction year was lower (higher) than the minimum (maximum) value observed over the instrumental period. In Brisbane, the RFI is unlikely (probabilities {\textless} 5\%) to have exhibited extremes beyond the minimum/maximum values observed between 1889 and 2019. However, in Fitzroy there are several years during the reconstruction period where the RFI is likely ({\textgreater}50\% probability) to have exhibited behavior beyond the minimum/maximum of what has been observed, during the instrumental period. For SPEI, the probability of observing such extremes prior to the beginning of the instrumental period in 1889 doesn't exceed 30\% in any reconstruction year in Brisbane, but exceeds 50\% in multiple years in Fitzroy.},

	abstract = {Palaeoclimate data relating to hydroclimate variability over the past millennia have a vital contribution to make to the water sector globally. The water industry faces considerable challenges accessing climate data sets that extend beyond that of historical gauging stations. Without this, variability around the extremes of floods and droughts is unknown and stress-testing infrastructure design and water demands is challenging. User-friendly access to relevant palaeoclimate data is now essential, and importantly, an efficient process to determine which proxies are most relevant to a planning scenario, and geographic area of interest. This paper presents PalaeoWISE (Palaeoclimate Data for Water Industry and Security Planning) a fully integrated, and quality-assured database of proxy data extracted from data repositories and publications collated in Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format. We demonstrate the application of the database in Queensland, one of Australia’s most hydrologically extreme states. The database and resultant hydroclimate correlations provides both the scientific community, and water resource managers, with a valuable resource to better manage for future climate changes.},
