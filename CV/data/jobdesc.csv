1,a,Scientist,"QLD Dept. of Natural Resources, Mining and Energy",Analysed cane trash trial data. 
1,b,Scientist,"QLD Dept. of Natural Resources, Mining and Energy",Found that there a significant proportion of the variation of sediment in cane paddock runoff can be described by soil type and cane trash cover.
2,a,PhD Researcher,University of Western Australia,Developed two new palaeo-climate proxy records for south east Australia
2,b,PhD Researcher,University of Western Australia,"Showed that the climate of the LIG has similar significant periodicities, suggesting our long term climate patterns (e.g. PDO) will continue as temperatures increase with climate change."
2,c,PhD Researcher,University of Western Australia,Used social network analysis to advance our understanding of methodologies applied in the speleothem palaeo-climate proxy community and the development of the field over time.
2,d,PhD Researcher,University of Western Australia,Demonstrated that LA-ICP-MS and LA-ICP-AES of trace elements in speleothem calcite produce comparable results
